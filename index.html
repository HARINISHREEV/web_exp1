       <p>Electrical and electronic engineers work at the forefront of technology, developing and improving the devices and systems we use every day. Electrical engineers deal with the generation, distribution and control of power, whereas electronic engineers create devices such as sensors and mobile phones.</p>
       <p>This accredited course provides the knowledge, skills and hands-on experience you need to become a work-ready engineer. Through laboratory sessions and a range of practical activities, you will embed the knowledge from your lectures and tutorials. There are opportunities for you to complete work placements and sponsorships through our connections to industry.</p>
       <p>You will explore a range of authentic engineering problems and industry-focused scenarios, both individually and with student engineers from other disciplines. Group work mirrors the relationships of an engineering team and will help you to build professional skills, such as teamwork and communication. Our open access makerspace provides a place for you to design, create and collaborate.</p>
       <p>You will have the opportunity to complete a salaried placement working in a location of your choosing, including outside of the UK. This is a great way to experience a professional working environment and put the skills you have learned into practice. In the past, our students have completed placements at Jaguar Land Rover, Network Rail, Siemens, Keysight Technologies and National Grid.

       <p>Of the hundred thousands engineering graduates produced every year, less than 5% of the engineers are produced by the pan-India national level autonomous institutes created by the acts of parliament, such as the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), National Institutes of Technology (NITs) and Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs)[citation needed],a little over 5% are produced by state level autonomous institutes and unitary universities approved by UGC. The remaining over 90% of the engineering graduates are produced by the private and non-autonomous state level engineering education institutes which must obtain the approval from the regulatory authority All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) to run such courses before they start admitting students.[1]</p>
       <p>There is long history of science and technology in the Indian subcontinent. The western style engineering education commenced during the British raj as a necessity for the training of overseers for construction and maintenance of public buildings, roads, canals, and ports, and for the training of artisans and craftsmen for the use of instruments, and apparatus needed for the army, the navy, and the survey department. While superintending engineers were mostly recruited from Britain, lower grade craftsmen, artisans and sub-overseers were recruited locally. The necessity to make them more efficient, led to the establishment of industrial schools attached to the Ordnance Factories Board and other engineering establishments.</p>
       

<p>In 1847, India's the first engineering college Thomason College of Civil Engineering (now called IIT Roorkee) was established at Roorkee in present day Uttarakhand state for the training of Civil Engineers. It was followed by College of Engineering, Pune's precursor, The Poona Engineering Class and Mechanical School in July 1854.</p>
